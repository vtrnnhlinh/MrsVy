# Mrs. Vy Discord Bot

This is my very first coding product. I am very very proud of it. It helped me passing through hard times, when I need motivation and inspiration.

But - “If someone loves a flower, of which just one single blossom grows, in all the millions of stars, it is enough to make him happy just to look at the stars.” - Antoine de Saint Exupéry, The Little Prince.

My apologize. I can't continue to develop you, BOT. But maybe I will, someday.
